"Negativity is a trait, not someones identity. A persons true nature can be obscured by clouds, but, like the sun, it is always there. And clouds can overcome any of us. We have to understand this when we deal with people who exude negative energy. Just like we wouldnt want someone to judge us by our worst moments, we must be careful not to do that to others. When someone hurts you, its because theyre hurt. Their hurt is simply spilling over. They need help. And as the Dalai Lama says, If you can, help others; if you cannot do that, at least do not harm them.

Critics, who judge others for either having a different opinion or not having one, for any choices theyve made that are different from what the critic would have done. Commanders, who realize their own limits but pressure others to succeed. Theyll say, You never have time for me, even though theyre busy as well. Competitors, who compare themselves to others, controlling and manipulating to make themselves or their choices look better. They are in so much pain that they want to bring others down.

"One might say that the ability to evaluate ones own ability is the most important skill of all. Without it, improvement is impossible. And certainly ego makes it difficult every step of the way. It is certainly more pleasurable to focus on our talents and strengths, but where does that get us? Arrogance and self-absorption inhibit growth. So does fantasy and vision.

"Why do you think that great leaders and thinkers throughout history have gone out into the wilderness and come back with inspiration, with a plan, with an experience that puts them on a course that changes the world? Its because in doing so they found perspective, they understood the larger picture in a way that wasnt possible in the bustle of everyday life. Silencing the noise around them, they could finally hear the quiet voice they needed to listen to. Creativity

"We have only minimal control over the rewards for our work and effortother peoples validation, recognition, rewards. So what are we going to do? Not be kind, not work hard, not produce, because there is a chance it wouldnt be reciprocated? Cmon. Think of all the activists who will find that they can only advance their cause so far. The leaders who are assassinated before their work is done. The inventors whose ideas languish ahead of their time. According to societys main metrics, these people were not rewarded for their work. Should they have not done it? Yet in ego, every one of us has considered doing precisely that. If that is your attitude, how do you intend to endure tough times? What if youre ahead of the times? What if the market favors some bogus trend? What if your boss or your clients dont understand? Its far better when doing good work is sufficient. In other words, the less attached we are to outcomes the better. When fulfilling our own standards is what fills us with pride and self-respect. When the effortnot the results, good or badis enough. With ego, this is not nearly sufficient. No, we need to be recognized. We need to be compensated. Especially problematic is the fact that, often, we get that. We are praised, we are paid, and we start to assume that the two things always go together. The expectation hangover inevitably ensues.

"...interests are not discovered through introspection. Instead, interests are triggered by interactions with the outside world. The process of interest discovery can be messy, serendipitous, and inefficient. This is because you can't really predict with certainty what will capture your attention and what won't...Without experimenting, you can't figure out which interests will stick, and which won't.

"Staying on the treadmill is one thing, and I do think its related to staying true to our commitments even when were not comfortable. But getting back on the treadmill the next day, eager to try again, is in my view even more reflective of grit. Because when you dont come back the next daywhen you permanently turn your back on a commitmentyour effort plummets to zero. As a consequence, your skills stop improving, and at the same time, you stop producing anything with whatever skills you have.

We focus on what we know and neglect what we do not know, which makes us overly confident in our beliefs.
